# Bowling Scorecard
Welcome to the bowling scorecard. Check out the instructions below to find out how to play!

### How to Play
* Clone this repo using the command `git clone https://github.com/Caitlin-cooling/bowling-challenge.git`
* Run the `scorecard.html` file in your chosen browser
* Click the buttons to register the roll that you made
* Note that each frame takes 2 rolls, and a running total is calculated once you have inputed your 2 rolls.

### Running the Tests
Tests are written using jasmine. To run the test please open the `SpecRunner.html` file in your chosen browser.

### Approach to Solving this Kata
I kept a methodical approach when solving this kata. I first created the JavaScript for a basic game. Then created an interface using HTML and jQuery. I then resolved edge cases around this for example, keeping track of the frame number, but telling the user that the  game is over after their 10th roll.

I test drove the JavaScript in this program using Jasmine.
